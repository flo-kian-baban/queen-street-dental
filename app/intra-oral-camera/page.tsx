                Dental imaging is a foundation of oral health diagnostics. Intra-oral cameras play a key role in office imaging, with many dentists using intra-oral cameras to detect the tiniest grooves, pits, cracks, and carries. Using a chairside unit and hand-held photographic wand, dentists can acquire images of the teeth from angles not previously available. These images can be used in treatment planning and also stored digitally for quick reference and easy transfer between care providers.

                <p>
                    intra-oral cameras are capable of magnifying the teeth by 25 times or more? Images are displayed on an in-office screen, making it possible for patients to finally see the same views their dentists are seeing. For some patients, intra-oral camera images are the first time they have seen the inside of their mouths. Many patients enjoy becoming a part of the examination and treatment process, and they can better understand treatment recommendations and the importance of good oral care in the future.

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

            <h3>How can a visit to a dentist with an intra-oral camera benefit me?</h3>
            <p>
                By choosing a dentist with an intra-oral camera, you could be increasing the chances that you will find decay early enough to pursue conservative treatment options. Furthermore, you are more likely to leave your dental appointments feeling informed and aware of your oral health and how it is impacted by your daily habits.

            <h3>What should I expect from intra-oral images?</h3>
            <p>
                Intra-oral images are painless and take only seconds to capture. Your dentist can take photos of an entire mandibular or maxillofacial arch in just two minutes or less.
            </p>

            <h3>Will I need more photos in the future?</h3>
            <p>
                If the early signs of decay are found on your intra-oral images, your dentist may obtain additional photos at subsequent visits for comparison. Monitoring the progression of decay can help determine whether treatment is necessary.
