                CEREC has changed the way dentists perform patient restorations. CEREC stands for &lsquo;ceramic reconstruction.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s a 3D imaging and camera assisted design center that allows dentists to take digital impressions of patient teeth and use the images to create a virtual restoration. The images can be sent to a dental laboratory for fabrication or combined with an in-office milling unit for same-day restorations. CEREC can be used to produce onlays, inlays, crowns or bridges without taking molded impressions.

                    that CEREC is a German technology that was first developed more than 30 years ago? Today, CEREC is setting new standards in dentistry and constantly evolving to adapt to the demands of dentists and their patients. When you choose a dentist specializing in CEREC assisted restorations, you are choosing a dentist who is dedicated to accuracy, efficiency, and durability.

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

            <h3>Can I benefit from CEREC?</h3>
            <p>
                Absolutely! CEREC can help anyone who needs an inlay, onlay, crown, bridge or even veneers. It takes only seconds to get accurate and detailed images of your teeth.
            </p>

            <h3>What should I expect from a CEREC dentist?</h3>
            <p>
                CEREC takes only seconds to obtain digital images. Your dentist will then use CEREC&rsquo;s CAD/CAM technology to virtually design a restoration. The amount of time this takes depends on your dentist&rsquo;s skill and experience using CEREC, as well as the complexity of your restoration.

            <h3>What are the long-term results with CEREC?</h3>
            <p>
                Following the placement of a crown or other restoration, you may feel some sensitivity for a few days. Though exact experiences vary from patient to patient, you can expect a crown produced using CEREC technology to last you many years so long as you use good oral hygiene and are not grinding your teeth.
